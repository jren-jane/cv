## :woman_teacher: Work experiences
- Conning
  - Quantitative Finance Analyst Intern
    - Derived the bound for numerical integration error, coded in a managed codebase to optimize the numerical integration parameters used for option pricing, built it for production and priced 100+ options for a client.
    - Coded entire option pricing process using Fourier transform.
    - Presented on the inflation-linked bond model, and explored ways to resolve the conflict of fitting the initial conditions and smoothing the time series. 
    - Practiced stochastic calculus and theoretically derived the characteristic functions and moments of the interest rate model, the inflation-linked bond model, and the equity model. Made Monte-Carlo simulations of the variables, and compared the results.
    - Plotted option and swaption volatility surfaces
    - Learned 2 new programming languages that are specific to the job, and converted data structures between them.
    - Tested new features of a software program.
- University of Konstanz
  - Teaching and Research Assistant
    - Conducted research in monetary economics. Built and coded a model to predict the inflation and output responses after a temporary VAT cut.
    - Studied UK price dataset to discover patterns in consumer prices.
    - Gave weekly tutorials in advanced macroeconomics and monetary economics.
- Shanghai New Oriental School
  - Teacher
    - Gave calculus and economics courses to students ranging from high school level to graduate school level.
    - Edited training materials and trained new teachers.
